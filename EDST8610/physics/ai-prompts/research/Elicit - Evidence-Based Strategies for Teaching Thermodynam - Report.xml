Digital simulations, microcomputer‐based laboratories, and hands‐on experiments improve comprehension of energy transfer, transformation, and thermal equilibrium when paired with brief conceptual change activities and cooperative tasks. For example, interventions that include thinking frames demonstrate markedly higher gains (effect size up to 2.04) compared with conventional instruction. Strategies that integrate historical contexts and real‐world applications also foster precise scientific literacy and numeracy. These findings support structuring the lesson into focused segments—such as 30 minutes on conceptual change, 45 minutes on interactive simulation, 45 minutes on a hands‐on experiment, and 30 minutes on guided problem solving— to engage visual, analytical, and kinesthetic learning pathways and manage cognitive load in line with the NSW Stage 6 syllabus for Year 11 Physics. </P></Sect><Sect><H4 id="LinkTarget_221">Paper search </H4><P>Using your research question ”Identify and justify evidence-based pedagogical strategies grounded in cognitive science and active learning methodologies for effectively teaching introductory thermodynamics within a constrained 3-hour lesson sequence to Year 11 Physics students (ages 16-17), aligned to the NSW Stage 6 syllabus. </P><P>The proposed strategies must directly address the challenge of limited instructional time while ensuring deep conceptual understanding of key syllabus concepts, including energy transfer, transformation, and thermal equilibrium.

across various educational contexts. The majority of studies focused on secondary education, with 21 out of 25 studies conducted in this setting. We found mention of quasi-experimental designs in 12 studies, making it the most commonly reported approach in our sample. Action research was the second most frequently mentioned, appearing in 10 studies. </P><P>The pedagogical frameworks employed varied widely, with constructivist approaches being the most commonly mentioned (5 studies), followed by Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning (4 studies). Problem-based learning and Project-Based Learning were each mentioned in 2 studies. We found 17 other frameworks that were each mentioned in only one study, highlighting the diversity of approaches in thermodynamics education. </P><P>Key interventions ranged from technology-enhanced learning (e.g., computer simulations, interactive digital boards) to hands-on experiments and project-based activities. This variety suggests a trend towards multi-modal and active learning strategies in thermodynamics education. </P></Sect><Sect><H4 id="LinkTarget_225">Thematic Analysis </H4><Sect><H5 id="LinkTarget_226">Cognitive Science-Based Instructional Strategies </H5><P>Evidence of Strategy Type Theoretical Foundation Implementation Method Effectiveness </P><P>Conceptual Change </P><P>Cognitive Flexibility </P><P>Meaningful Learning </P><P>Constructivist Approach </P><P>Thinking Frames </P><P>Problem-Based Learning </P><Table><TR><TD>Spiral Cognitive-Sociocultural Model of Conceptual Change (SCSMCC) </TD><TD>Six phases of SCSMCC and Reasoned Persuasive Collaboration (RPC) method </TD><TD>Significant positive differences and medium effect size in tests, attitudes, and motivations </TD></TR><TR><TD>Cognitive Flexibility Theory </TD><TD>Interdisciplinary approach with simulations and </TD><TD>We didn't find explicit mention of effectiveness in the abstract </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning </TD><TD>hypermedia Construction of thermal machines, UEPS, Arduino-based experiments, Active teaching approach </TD><TD>Increased student interest and participation, Significant improvement in formulation of heat and </TD></TR><TR><TD>Constructivist learning theory Conceptual change strategy </TD><TD>Integrated sensory model, Interactive digital board, Activity-based approach, MBL activities Thinking frames approach </TD><TD>temperature concepts Significant outperformance of experimental groups, Improvement in understanding main topics Effect size = 2.04 for thinking frames approach vs 0.20 for traditional methods </TD></TR><TR><TD>Problem-based learning theory </TD><TD>Problem-based guides, PBL model for thermodynamics </TD><TD>Significant improvement in understanding heat and temperature concepts, Significant improvement in conceptual understanding and argumentation skills </TD></TR></Table><P>Evidence of Strategy Type Theoretical Foundation Implementation Method Effectiveness </P><P>Project-Based Learning Project-Based Learning STEM-integrated PjBL, (PBL) theory Project-based activities </P><P>5E Instructional Model Piaget's and Vygotsky's 5E model for heat and theories temperature concepts Significant impact on creative thinking abilities development (N-gain = 0.353, d-effect = 2.069), Evidence of significant learning shown by conceptual </P><P>progress Statistically significant improvement in posttest scores (p=0.004) </P><P>Our analysis identified mention of 8 different theoretical foundations across the studies, with each appearing in one study based on the available information.
