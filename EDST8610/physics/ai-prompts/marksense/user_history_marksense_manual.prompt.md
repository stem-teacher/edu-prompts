# Initial Prompt
Now, as an aside, with the technology developed, it should be possible to create an instructional scenario where a teacher prepares a lesson during which students are provided with handouts containing both multiple-choice and written-answer questions. Upon completing these handouts, students can scan their responses using a scanner located in the classroom. Immediately after scanning and returning to their seats, they receive an email containing a complete grading summary alongside detailed feedback. Feedback for the written-answer questions is generated utilising a pre-established, AI-supported rubric, whereby an AI evaluates the scanned images of students’ responses.

Could you please draft a comprehensive description or manual for this process? This documentation should clearly instruct a teacher on how to utilise the system effectively. Furthermore, it should guide an AI—when generating assessment handouts—to correctly prepare templates and establish a reliable mechanism that links each scanned exam back to its corresponding marking template.


# Prompt to Revise Manual
1. This document must be written in the active voice from the perspective that the technology is fully developed. For example, wherever the document currently reads "MarkSense aims to streamline", it must be revised to read "MarkSense streamlines". Likewise, the phrase "This guide outlines the ideal workflow from assessment creation to automated grading" should be amended to clearly state: "This guide outlines the workflow from assessment creation to automated grading."

2. Regarding the template set-up, it seems feasible to utilise AI capability to automatically generate grading templates, especially when instructional materials are prepared using markdown formatting and include scientific notations such as equations and chemical formulae expressed in LaTeX. A customised version of the Tufte LaTeX template could ideally support this automated workflow. Could you please incorporate guidance around this?

3. Consider that a minimal and intuitive User Interface (UI) is required to facilitate easy and non-technical set-up and management of classes for teachers. Assume this UI already exists and draft the documentation accordingly, clearly and concisely phrased from the perspective of a classroom teacher who possesses limited technical knowledge.

4. In the section "**Linking Template to Scans:**", the documentation must emphasise clearly that the handout preparation system independently manages the entire linking process. In practice, this linking solution must be absolutely reliable; if the system is not completely robust and straightforward, it cannot be practically deployed in an everyday classroom environment.

5. Rubric creation is a critical component of this solution, requiring careful and considered attention from teachers to ensure the rubric delivers high-quality, meaningful feedback to each student. Clearly present rubric establishment as central to practically supporting student-centred learning approaches.

6. Avoid detailing the full PDF annotation process in the teacher’s version of the instructional documentation. Instead, draft the content specifically and clearly for a classroom teacher who has limited technical background. Provide the technical description of all underlying mechanisms and detailed annotation steps separately, as a dedicated technical guidance document.
