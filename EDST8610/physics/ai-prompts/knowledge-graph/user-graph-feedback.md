# Feedback Synthesis Plan: NSW HSC Physics Knowledge Graph

## Approach for Synthesizing AI Validation Feedback

This document outlines the systematic approach for integrating feedback from multiple AI validation sources (OpenAI and Gemini) to enhance the NSW HSC Physics knowledge graph.

## Step 1: Feedback Collection

1. **Submit the validation prompts** to both OpenAI and Gemini
2. **Maintain separation** between feedback sources to identify differences in perspective
3. **Document all responses** in full before beginning synthesis

## Step 2: Categorization of Feedback

Organize all feedback points according to these categories:

1. **Syllabus Alignment Issues**
   - Missing required topics
   - Incorrect module organization
   - Outdated content
   - Misaligned emphasis areas

2. **Dependency Relationships**
   - Incorrect prerequisites
   - Missing dependencies
   - Overestimated dependencies
   - Circular dependencies

3. **Concept Coverage**
   - Concepts requiring further breakdown
   - Redundant concepts
   - Concepts outside syllabus scope
   - Under-represented areas

4. **Difficulty and Fundamentality Ratings**
   - Inaccurate difficulty assessments
   - Misaligned fundamentality ratings
   - Inconsistent rating patterns

5. **Learning Pathways**
   - Suboptimal sequencing suggestions
   - Missing alternative pathways
   - Ineffective gateway concept identification

6. **Misconceptions and Learning Obstacles**
   - Additional common misconceptions
   - Missing key learning obstacles
   - Teaching strategy recommendations

## Step 3: Feedback Analysis Process

For each feedback category:

1. **Create a comparison matrix**
   - Place OpenAI feedback points in column 1
   - Place Gemini feedback points in column 2
   - Identify agreements and disagreements

2. **Weigh the evidence**
   - Prioritize feedback points with specific justifications
   - Look for references to NSW syllabus documentation
   - Consider logical consistency and pedagogical reasoning
   - Note where both AI systems agree (high confidence)

3. **Resolve contradictions**
   - When AI systems disagree, research the official NSW NESA documentation
   - Consider your own expertise and experience
   - Consult external sources if needed for verification
   - Document reasoning for chosen resolution

## Step 4: Integration Framework

Create specific action items for knowledge graph enhancement:

1. **Structural Modifications**
   - Adding missing concepts/skills
   - Reorganizing modules
   - Refining prerequisite relationships
   - Adjusting difficulty/fundamentality ratings

2. **Content Enrichment**
   - Adding detailed descriptions
   - Expanding misconception lists
   - Including learning obstacles
   - Adding specific examples

3. **Learning Pathway Refinement**
   - Optimizing sequence progression
   - Creating alternative pathways for different learner types
   - Highlighting key transition points
   - Emphasizing verified gateway concepts

## Step 5: JSON Structure Enhancement

Update the JSON representation with:

1. **Metadata Improvements**
   - Version tracking
   - Validation sources
   - Confidence ratings for dependencies
   - NSW syllabus alignment references

2. **Extended Properties**
   - Teaching strategies
   - Common assessment challenges
   - Instructional time recommendations
   - Resource requirements

3. **Visualization Hooks**
   - Tags for concept mapping
   - Grouping properties
   - Relationship strength indicators
   - Difficulty progression markers

## Step 6: Final Validation

Before implementation:

1. **Self-review**
   - Check for logical consistency
   - Verify all syllabus topics are addressed
   - Ensure balanced coverage across topics
   - Confirm pedagogical soundness

2. **Document changes**
   - Track all modifications made based on feedback
   - Note the reasoning for accepting/rejecting specific suggestions
   - Document any areas requiring future refinement

3. **Plan for practical testing**
   - Identify strategies for testing knowledge graph with students
   - Prepare to collect empirical data on concept difficulties
   - Design evaluation metrics for pathway effectiveness

## Step 7: Implementation Planning

Develop an approach to use the enhanced knowledge graph for:

1. **Curriculum sequencing**
   - Year and term planning
   - Unit design
   - Lesson sequencing

2. **Assessment design**
   - Targeted formative assessments
   - Diagnostic tools
   - Summative assessment alignment

3. **Intervention mapping**
   - Identifying probable struggle points
   - Creating remediation materials
   - Developing extension pathways

4. **Resource development**
   - Concept-specific teaching materials
   - Targeted misconception activities
   - Learning pathway guidance for students
