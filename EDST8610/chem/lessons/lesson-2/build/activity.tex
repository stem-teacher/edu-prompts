\section*{Aim}
To practice planning and representing short (2-3 step) organic synthesis pathways using your knowledge of reactions and the visualisation tool.

\section*{Instructions}
Work with your partner. For each problem below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the starting material and the target product.
    \item Use the Chord Diagram Visualisation tool to help you brainstorm possible reaction sequences. Identify necessary intermediates.
    \item On your mini-whiteboard or paper (or Worksheet 2), write out the step-by-step reaction pathway.
    \item For each step, clearly show the structure (or IUPAC name) of the reactant and product.
    \item Above/below the reaction arrow for each step, write the necessary reagent(s) and conditions.
    \item Be prepared to explain your chosen pathway.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Synthesis Problems}

\textbf{Problem Set A:}
Propose a 2-step synthesis pathway for the conversion of **ethene** to **ethanoic acid**.

\textbf{Problem Set B:}
Propose a synthesis pathway for the conversion of **propane** to **propanone**. (Hint: This might take more than 2 steps).

\vspace{1cm} \hrulefill \vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Problem Set C:}
Propose a synthesis pathway for the conversion of **1-bromobutane** to **butanoic acid**.

\vspace{1cm} \hrulefill \vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Problem Set D (Ester Challenge):}
Propose a synthesis pathway for the conversion of **propene** to **propyl ethanoate**. (Hint: You'll need to synthesise both the alcohol and the acid parts, potentially from the propene starting material if possible, or assume ethanoic acid is available).

\vspace{1cm} \hrulefill \vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Metacognitive Prompts (Consider while working):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What functional group change is needed?
    \item What reaction(s) can achieve this change? (Check the visualizer!)
    \item What reagents/conditions are specific to that reaction?
    \item Is there another way to make this connection?
\end{itemize}
